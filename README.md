# FishAppTechDemo
Expo demo created for Fish app. Shows local database utilization and React Native app development.  
## How to install/run.  
Run `npx expo start` in folder
# USAGE.  
ONLY SUPPORTS SIZE.    
update button updates size for a PIT tag # entered.   
Creates new entry in DB if nonexistant. (need to learn how DB ships with app files).  
Get function just gets size for PIT tag entered
reset button drops table.      
# ISSUES
Haven't tested on anything but iPhone 14 Pro Simulator. Also theres some libraries that aren't used yet
